You will need to create and register a GitHub App under your personal account or under any organization you have administrative access to.

> _Learn more about [creating GitHub Apps][creating-a-github-app]._

##### Org vs. Personal

Depending on your usage, your entry point for creating a GitHub app will differ:

- **Personal Accounts**: `https://github.com/settings/apps/new`
- **GitHub Accounts** `https://github.com/organizations/[your-org-name]/settings/apps/new`

<!-- TODO: add GitHub Enterprise Option -->

You'll be asked provide details for the app, here are the **required** values:

#### GitHub App name

Can be anything, suggest using `colophon` + `you-org-name` as a suffix

> _e.g. `my-company-colophon`_

#### Homepage URL

Set to `https://colophon.id`

#### User authorization callback URL

The full URL to redirect to after a user authorizes an installation.

Use `https://your-app-domain` + `/auth/callback`

> _e.g. `https://colophon.my-company.com/auth/callback`_

- **Related Environment Variable**: [`COLOPHON_LINK`](./environment.md/#COLOPHON_LINK)

#### Webhook URL

Events will `POST` to this URL.

Use the root url of the app `https://your-app-domain`

> _e.g. `https://colophon.my-company.com/`_

- **Related Environment Variable**: [`COLOPHON_LINK`](./environment.md/#COLOPHON_LINK)

##### Webhook secret _(optional)_

While optional, this is recommended to ensure your Colophon data is secure from external manipulation

> _e.g. `oopee2Ie-Noethoh0-eoS6xah4-yeemeu9U`_

- **Related Environment Variable**: [`GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`](./environment.md/#GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET)

### Generating a Private key
